# hello-world
First repository I am wrting ever

Hello people,
I don't really know much about coding, programming etc. but I think I can learn and use my skills in the (near) future. I'm a senior high school student in Turkey so I don't really have much time until mid-June. I'm planning to learn more about blockchain and big data analysis.
